# TractorTweaks

This is tractortweaks! It's a modpack that aims to bring back the child-like wonder that early versions of the game had brought to us before, whilst still working with modern versions of the game. It also adds a few other odds and ends, in an attempt to bring back some pre-release aspects of the game, such as my E3 2014 HUD mod (which would be its first release!). If you want to tweak anything yourself, go right ahead! You'll need the Mod Builder and a copy of the game, just place all these files in `Scripts/Mod/TractorTweaks/` and follow the instructions laid out on the Mod Builder's github.

Todo: Screenshots. Happy exploring!

## Legal Notice

Obviously, a few of these mods aren't mine or are derived from other people's works. I can assure you all of the scripts that start with `tractorbeam` are mine entirely, however the others... Well, some of them needed extensive editing to work with the mods I have created so unfortunately I am forced to pack them in with everything else in the repo. If you are the creator of any of these mods, hit me up @tractorbeam on discord! I'm sure we can work something out.

## Release Notice

*THIS IS IN* ***MIGHTY*** *EARLY DEVELOPMENT.* Whenever I feel a pak is clean enough of rough edges to release, I'll stick it under releases, but for now you'll have to build this yourself to obtain it. I just want to keep anybody who doesn't understand the development process from complaining about things that are... well... under development.
